/**
 * @question: Create a class with variable(s) and method(s) (all will be default
 *            accessed) under package
 *            pOne. Now create a class under package pTwo, which is subclass of
 *            firstly created class. In
 *            the method here (i.e. class of pTwo) call variable(s) and
 *            method(s) of previous class (i.e.
 *            class of pOne). If errors come, rectify them. Now from Main (under
 *            working directory)
 *            access second classâ€™s members.
